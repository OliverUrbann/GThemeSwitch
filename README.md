# GThemeSwitch

Just a simple shell script that saves current theme settings, e.g. by using [Tweaks](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Tweaks),
in a new shell script. You can then switch between your theme settings by just running these generated shell scripts.

## Usage

Just run save_theme.sh e.g. by double clicking, select if this is a light or dark theme. Then just double click one of the
theme scripts.
